### Note: Downloading the latest release is sometimes required even if you've downloaded a soundpack before, if new sounds are added.

## Installation guide:
- Choose and download a voice .zip in [github Releases](https://github.com/cdrg/poe1filtertts/releases/latest), such as "AWSPolly-Brian.zip"
- Extract the "sounds" folder in the .zip to your Path of Exile 1 filter folder
  - Leave the "sounds" folder intact.
  - There's a button in Options > Game to open the filter folder.

## Bug reports or suggestions:

Make suggestions or bug reports on [Discord](https://discord.gg/gRMjT5gVms) or the reddit thread. Also if you want to see particular voice from [AWS Polly](https://ttsmp3.com/), [TTS.Monster](https://tts.monster/), etc.

Git pull requests welcome, like adding items to the template.json.

## Quest item sound: 

If you don't like the quest item sound (AKA "Progress is literally how you're measured").

Replace the "quest item.mp3" file with a file of your choice, eg one from the [Voicelines](https://github.com/cdrg/poe1filtertts/tree/main/voicelines) folder.
