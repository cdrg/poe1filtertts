Text-To-Speech sound file packs for Path of Exile 1 item filters

If you want to see particular voice from [AWS Polly](https://ai-service-demos.go-aws.com/polly), [TTS.Monster](https://tts.monster/), etc suggest it on Discord!

### Note: Custom sound files and item filters that use them only work on PC, not console.

### Note: Downloading the latest release is sometimes required even if you've downloaded a soundpack before, if new sounds are added.
