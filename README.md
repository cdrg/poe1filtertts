Make suggestions or bug reports on Discord or the reddit thread.

## Quest item sound: 

If you don't like the quest item sound (AKA "Progress is literally how you're measured").

Replace the "quest item.mp3" file with a file of your choice, eg one from the [Voicelines](https://github.com/cdrg/poe1filtertts/tree/main/voicelines) folder.
